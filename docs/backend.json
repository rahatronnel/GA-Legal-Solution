    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to manage real estate property data, uploads, and user-related information. It prioritizes authorization independence by avoiding `get()` calls in security rules through denormalization and structural segregation.\n\n*   **Properties Collection:** Stores the main property details. There is no owner here, so we assume all properties are visible and manageable by admins.\n*   **Uploads Subcollection:** Each `Property` can have multiple `Upload` documents. This approach ensures proper data isolation and supports more granular security rules if needed in the future. The `propertyId` is used to link uploads to properties and is denormalized.\n\nThe structure supports QAPs by segregating data with different access needs into separate collections.  Property information and uploads can be listed without requiring filtering based on authorization, as all properties and uploads are readable, and only admins can manage them.  If private property drafts were needed, they would be stored in `/users/{userId}/drafts`."
